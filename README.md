## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Even though this is a project that we can mainly develop in HTML and CSS, I developed it in React using components and CSS for the styles. This project was important to understand CSS properties as "flex-wrap" and "flex-direction", as well as the shorthand "flex-flow".Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

Regarding the functionality of this challenge in reaction, I used several components to avoid repeating code and to have reusable components, like as "Ratings" and "Reviews", all of them content in a "Master" component.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, Bootstrap, Tailwind among others.

### Useful resources
